Data Analysis: The first thoughts when people received their Iphone7 

Brief Description:

This project is a team case study in class DS501 (Introduction to Data Science) at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). It analyzed how people feel about iPhone 7 on Twitter by collecting more than 60K tweets during 9:00AM to 12:00PM on September 16, 2016, the time when iPhone 7 was first launched into market.

With the help of several Python libraries, including Numpy, Matplotlib, PrettyTable and Natural Language Toolkits (NLTK), the tweets we collected suggests that iPhone 7 seems to be appreciated by a large portion of customers. In addition, several "hot" features was analyzed in detail, such as "Jet black", "Camera", "Waterproof", and "Headphone". The results indicate that most customers are satisfied by the first three features, whereas only 25% customers's tweets are positive towards the headphone, probably because Apple discard the 3.5mm headphone jack.
